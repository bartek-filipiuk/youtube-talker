First we need to check if any docker containers are using ports so we can avoid iteration with
changing ports by llm

For each stage:

ok we are ready to stage 3. its 3.1 to 3.6 i think we can split this 
into smaller pull request to main, verify if each 3.1-3.6 should be a 
separate pr or we can merge something into little bigger prs? Then you 
cna plan the work with @PROJECT_FLOW_DOCS/INIT_PROMPT.md also if you 
see in stage 3 something is too open or may lead to overcomplications, 
ask me 5 short questions which will clarify what we need in stage 3.
