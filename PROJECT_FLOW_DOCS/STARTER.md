Ok, I'm building a web application, tentatively called YoutubeTalker.
Read this and see how it works and what it consists of.

First, isolate the stack and functions for the MVP and what needs to be done.
Analyze it thoroughly, see what rules we have in @DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md.

Then ask me 12 precise questions that will help us build the MVP without problems or the application becoming blurred by too many MVP functions.
Remember, we'll be developing it, so everything must be extensible.

Let me know what I'm missing here, if I've omitted something that's a must-have, or if there might be any issues.

----

What functions, how should it work?

The general idea is that when I enter the chat, I can talk to the LLM, who draws his knowledge from YouTube videos that we previously transcribed. This works on a RAG basis, meaning the texts are cached and we query the Qdrant database.

Chat per batch of YouTube videos or uploaded by channel - in MVP, we set specific UUIDs/IDs for the knowledge batch in the chat. Each transcription has a metadata and its own UUID/ID, and the RAG is generated based on that.

In MVP, this is hardcoded; we create one chat with one batch of transcripts.

We transcribe using the SupaBase API.
We use LLm with OpenRouter.
For embeddings, we use OpenRouter Embeddings Small.
For speech, we hardcode the anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5 model (OpenRouter).
But in the future, we'll be able to choose between them, so we need to have the appropriate structure in our code for this.

Qdrant Vector Database
As a front-end, we'll use the Astro Framework.
- Postgres database.
- We need user/pass authentication (mail in the future), users, and sessions.

In the database itself, we also need tables for:
- Full transcripts with metadata from YouTube videos (metadata will be available in the SupaData API Response).
- Content, divided into types, such as LinkedIn, Transcription, X, and others, can be added.

In MVP, we don't need to have database integration at the UI level. For now, we'll be manually adding types, for example. Content and transcripts will be sent from the API via some endpoint.

The main API will be built based on fastAPI.
- Websockets
- Initial configuration of slowAPI and rate limits.

The entire RAG is based on LangChain and LangGraph, so that SMith can later be connected as an observability.

How it will work:

A user is in the chat by ID.
Using this ID, they have access to the appropriate chunks.
They can ask a question about something in the chat, and LLM *haiku* answers it using its knowledge.
- The question is embedded and a query is sent to qdrant.
The chat itself will likely receive websockets sent from the main API.
The response will be formatted into simple HTML and displayed as a reply.
You can copy it to the clipboard.

Among the features that would be nice to have in MVP, there's one template to use - LinkedIn.

What would it look like, for example, if a user writes "What topics can I write as LinkedIn posts?"
LLM returns, say, 5 titles/topics.
The user says to create a LinkedIn post with "Selected title."
LLM in the background (also a rag) collects content and composes it according to a template for what a LinkedIn post should look like and spits it out to the user.
For now, the template will be hardcoded, but it's important to anticipate that users will be able to change it. This means we need to have a per-user template stored somewhere in the database. If not, it uses the default one. MVP doesn't allow for changing the template; only the default one is used.


12 Critical Questions for MVP Clarity

  Data Architecture & Storage

  1. Chat History Persistence: Should chat conversations be stored in
   PostgreSQL for the MVP? If yes, do we need full message history or
   just the current session? This affects database schema and
  WebSocket state management.

  2. Transcript Chunking Strategy: What chunking approach for RAG -
  fixed token size (e.g., 512 tokens), semantic chunking by
  paragraphs, or sliding windows with overlap? This directly impacts
  retrieval quality and needs to be decided upfront.

  3. Qdrant Collection Structure: Single Qdrant collection with
  metadata filtering (by batch_id/channel_id), or separate
  collections per batch? This affects query performance and
  multi-tenancy architecture.

  Content Ingestion & Processing

  4. Transcript Ingestion Pipeline: For MVP, is the ingestion flow:
  (a) Manual API call with YouTube URL → SupaBase transcription →
  Auto-chunk & embed → Qdrant, OR (b) Admin uploads pre-transcribed
  JSON files? Where does this endpoint live?

  5. Batch/Content Management: In MVP, you mention "one hardcoded
  chat with one batch of transcripts" - should this be a
  configuration constant in the code, or a database record that can
  be changed without redeployment?

  6. Content Types Table: The "Content" table with types (LinkedIn,
  Transcription, X) - in MVP, is this just for future-proofing the
  schema, or do we actively categorize chunks by content type? How
  does this relate to the transcripts table?

  Authentication & Authorization

  7. User-to-Batch Access Control: You mention "user has access to
  appropriate chunks by chat ID" - for MVP with one hardcoded batch,
  do ALL authenticated users access the same batch, or do we need a
  user_batches junction table from the start?

  8. Session Management Details: Should sessions be JWT-based
  (stateless) or server-side sessions stored in PostgreSQL? How long
  should sessions last in MVP (e.g., 24 hours, 7 days)?

  LinkedIn Template Feature

  9. LinkedIn Template Variables: What specific variables should the
  hardcoded LinkedIn template support? (e.g., {topic}, {key_points},
  {tone}, {call_to_action}). This defines the LangChain prompt
  structure.

  10. Template Storage Schema: Even though MVP uses default template
  only, should we create the templates table now with fields like
  user_id (nullable), template_type, template_content, is_default, or
   defer this until post-MVP?

  RAG & LLM Configuration

  11. RAG Context Window: How many chunks should be retrieved per
  query (top-k)? What's the max context size to send to Haiku (e.g.,
  3-5 chunks ~2000 tokens)? This affects retrieval parameters and
  prompt engineering.

  12. LangGraph Agent Flow: For the LinkedIn post generation (suggest
   topics → user selects → generate post), should this be:
  - (a) Two separate LangChain calls (simple, stateless)
  - (b) A LangGraph agent with state persistence tracking
  conversation context
  - (c) Just store the previous assistant message in WebSocket state?

Answers.

1. we need keep then full history from the beginning, each conversation will 
have uuid so user after log in will see the history and can go back to conversation
i also think about something like conversation summary so llm will know what is going on

- some prototype for the memory but nothing complicated - maybe we do not need thsi in mvp?

2. chunking.
Basic Parameters (Good Starting Point)

Size (Limit): 500–1000 tokens per chunk (Recommended: 700 tokens).
Overlap: 15–25% (e.g., 20% → if a chunk has 700 tokens, overlap ≈ 140 tokens).
Minimum Size: Don't create chunks < 100–150 tokens—instead, append another sentence(s).
Tokenizer: Count the tokens used by your embedder (not characters), e.g., tiktoken / model tokenizer.

chunks need to have metadata, youtube video ID for sure so we will have a reference

3. single collection
4. for the mvp we just need endpoint in out api so we can use youtube url and then
we pass the url to SUPADATA (not supabase) api and in response we will have full transcription and metadata.
Remember we have researcher agent available in claude code so use it if you want to see any documentation
for example supadata api documentation
5. we just need a one predefined batch of data - transcriptions and chunks connected to account/user so if user
logged in and use llm then we are looking only with transcriptions/chunks related to that account. So in the future if system will evolve
each user can be send youtube movie/movies to transctipt and chunking. all can be categorized (we need that in metadata) 
Ypu know, data in database will be connected to user, os this could be possible that we will have duplicates in chunks
if two users load same movie - but for now we need one user and one portion of movies connected to that user.
6. no chunk type, this will be content which will be created based on some template (for now we need one hardcoded template - linkedin)
this content will be generated based on chunks data for some subject. SO if user type, write me a linkedin post about TOPIC
And we have data for that topic in our chunks (we use only knowledge from chunks) then llm will create a post based on template (format, etc)
7. see point 5. for now one user one portion of data connected to that user. 
8. i think we need a standard style log in so session stored in database, 7 days long then logout.
9. we need separate structure n the filesystem so we can add more templates
in the future it will be possible that user will update the template for himself via UI but for mvp it will be hardcoded in file
For now we just need to use some standard linkedin post format. SO yes, we can go with yout proposition of vars.
10. yes we need template table now, use all needed fields to connetc this to the system
11. that is the question, maybe we can grab 12 chunks and introduce some grading step in graph, grading by llm, WHat do you think?
12. i think option B

also we need user question checker so llm can see that user want to linkedin post
or just ask about what videos are loaded for his account - this can be different way do get data through graph
so first step in langchain graph should be that llm will check the question and then can choose different path of flow.
There will be different flow if user ask for linkedin post
and difdernet flow will be if user will ask "how are you"
But for now we do not need too complex, just some basic question grading.
If possible each flow with his way based on user query should be stored clearly in the structure so it will be easy to change/extend.

OK there are some extra questions here. Read my answers carefully, see if now yuo have more clarification.
If something is open and you feel we can talk more to be sure we will have not too overcomplicated mvp - ask me 4 more questions.

Also tell me if i missing something. 
I know about rate limits - we can use slowAPI
I know we need proper error handling etc - obvious
For sure we will add observability at some end stages for mvp - Lang Smith
Database schemas is on your side, you probably know better than me this subject :)
Also we can go with your recommendations you wrote.

So you have a view, i want you to check and see how to build solid mvp, not overcomplicated but ready to extend.

You wrote - checkbox = 1PR, it will be dynamic, sometimes we will create feature branch based on whole stage

4 Final Questions

  1. Conversation Memory & Summaries (MVP Scope Decision)

  You mentioned "conversation summary so llm will know what is going
  on" but questioned if it's needed in MVP. Here's the tradeoff:

  Option A (Simpler MVP):
  - No summaries, just send last N messages (e.g., 10) from chat
  history as context to LangGraph
  - Works fine for short conversations (<20 messages)
  - Easier to implement

  Option B (Better UX, slightly complex):
  - After every 15-20 messages, create a rolling summary
  - Send: [summary of old messages] + [last 10 raw messages]
  - Prevents context window bloat for long conversations

  Question: For MVP, should we go with Option A (last N messages
  only) or Option B (summaries)? My recommendation: Option A for MVP,
   add summaries post-MVP.

  2. LLM Chunk Grading - Selection Criteria

  You said "grab 12 chunks → grading step by LLM" - I need to
  understand the grading output:

  Question: After LLM grades 12 chunks, should it:
  - (a) Score each chunk 1-10 and keep top 5 highest-scored chunks?
  - (b) Binary filter (relevant/not relevant) and keep all "relevant"
   ones?
  - (c) Return a fixed number (e.g., top 3-5) regardless of scores?

  And what should the grading prompt evaluate - relevance to user
  question, information density, or something else?

  3. Generated Content Persistence

  The content_types table for LinkedIn, X posts, etc. - when user
  generates a LinkedIn post:

  Question: Should the generated content be:
  - (a) Saved to database with fields like: user_id, content_type
  (enum: linkedin/x/etc), content_text, source_chunks (array of chunk
   IDs), created_at - so users can browse their generated posts
  later?
  - (b) Just returned via WebSocket and stored in chat history table
  (as part of conversation)?
  - (c) Not persisted at all beyond the chat message?

  This affects whether we need a separate generated_content table or
  just rely on chat history.

  4. LinkedIn Flow - Context Retrieval Clarification

  When user says "create a LinkedIn post about [TOPIC]":

  Question: Should the system:
  - (a) Direct RAG approach: Embed the topic → retrieve 12 chunks
  about that topic → grade → generate post (doesn't care about
  previous conversation)
  - (b) Stateful approach: If user previously asked "what topics can
  I write about?" and LLM suggested 5 topics, remember those
  suggestions and use them as context when generating the post
  - (c) Hybrid: Try (b) first if recent topic suggestions exist in
  conversation, otherwise fall back to (a)

  My recommendation: Option (a) for MVP simplicity - user can ask for
   topic suggestions, see them, then explicitly request post
  generation. LangGraph routing handles both as separate flows
  

1. Go with option A, 10 last messages (configurable somewhere). 
But nom im aftaid about long questions but i think we will just add validation for message mength and thats it - no worries
2. B, llm jus will check each and grade with user query and decide if there is enough info about topic
so we could have 12 chunks used to prepare answer and also 3 chunks used for example
3. B for now
4. option A for now, probably B is the goal but post-mvp we will introduce some cache and memory, not now.

Review CLAUDE.md, i moved ot to the root of project, if its not too overcomplicated also we can add there some important rules

What we need also:
- we need to be sure we are using latest stable libraries which are compatible to each other
- we are using best coding standards for backend and frontend
- we need use gh cli to comint, push creating pr etc
- you know we have a researcher agent so if yuo need more info about implementing an external api or other you can use it to grab more knowledge
- we need also other useful rules - put all in CLAUDE.md but do not overcomplicate it, need to be solid and short

we will use "docker compose" not docker-compose

And about docker, what is the plan, what will be in containers.
Remember we will move it to server (where we can use docker too)
So our local need to be the same as prod. But what is the best approach for containers in this project
In prod, probably we will use Caddy as a web server/proxy - but not on local
so caddy will not be in container i think. - WHat do yuo think, what will be a best approach for us.


---
1. session

ok we can start developing, see @PROJECT_FLOW_DOCS/INIT_PROMPT.md  we
  will work on stage 1.1 - 1.4 in separated branch. Repo is added, main
  branch is main. After each stage we need a commit. verify all first,
  see on what we will be working, summary in short then wait for approval

2. session

 Phase [2]: Work on stages [2.1]-[2.6] from HANDOFF.md.
  - New branch from main
  - One checkbox at a time
  - Follow all acceptance criteria and testing requirements
  - Commit after each completed stage (so 6 commits initially)
  - Update HANDOFF.md checkboxes
  - Create PR when phase complete

check @DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md 
check @DATABASE_SCHEMA.md

Summarize the work first, then wait for approval.

STAGE 3.

Before stage 3 i put the prompt:

ok we are ready to stage 3. its 3.1 to 3.6 i think we can split this 
into smaller pull request to main, verify if each 3.1-3.6 should be a 
separate pr or we can merge something into little bigger prs? Then you 
cna plan the work with @PROJECT_FLOW_DOCS/INIT_PROMPT.md also if you 
see in stage 3 something is too open or may lead to overcomplications, 
ask me 5 short questions which will clarify what we need in stage 3.

Analysis of Phase 3 Stages

  Stage Dependencies:
  - 3.1 Security Utilities → Foundation (no deps)
  - 3.2 Auth Service → Depends on 3.1
  - 3.3 Pydantic Schemas → Independent
  - 3.4 API Endpoints → Depends on 3.2 + 3.3
  - 3.5 Auth Dependency → Depends on 3.2
  - 3.6 Integration Tests → Depends on all above

  Logical PR Grouping Options:

  Option A: 2 PRs (Recommended)
  - PR #3: 3.1 + 3.2 + 3.3 (Core auth logic: security utils, service,
  schemas with unit tests)
  - PR #4: 3.4 + 3.5 + 3.6 (API layer: endpoints, dependency,
  integration tests)

  Option B: 3 PRs (More Granular)
  - PR #3: 3.1 + 3.2 (Security utilities + Auth service with unit
  tests)
  - PR #4: 3.3 + 3.4 + 3.5 (Schemas + Endpoints + Dependency)
  - PR #5: 3.6 (Integration tests)

  Option C: 1 Large PR
  - All of 3.1-3.6 together

  Potential Over-Complications Found

  Looking at the specs, I see a few areas that could lead to
  over-engineering or missed requirements:

  1. Session cleanup - No mention of deleting expired sessions
  automatically
  2. Password complexity - Only "min length 8" specified
  3. Login security - No rate limiting mentioned (but WebSocket has it
  in Phase 7)
  4. Session expiry testing - "mock time if needed" could be complex
  5. Error handling - Should failed login attempts be logged for
  security?

  5 Short Clarifying Questions

  1. Expired session cleanup:
  Manual deletion only, or add a background task/cron job to
  auto-delete expired sessions for MVP?

  2. Password validation:
  Just minimum length 8, or add complexity requirements
  (uppercase/numbers/special characters)?

  3. Login rate limiting:
  Should we add rate limiting to /api/auth/login to prevent brute force
   attacks? (SlowAPI is already in stack)

  4. Session expiry testing:
  Test with actual time.sleep() delays, or just verify the expiry logic
   without mocking time to keep tests fast?

  5. PR grouping:
  Preference: 2 PRs (logic layer + API layer) or 3 PRs (more granular
  security→service→API)?

  ---
  My Recommendation: Option A (2 PRs) balances reviewability with
  efficiency, and I'd suggest:
  - Auto-cleanup: Manual only for MVP (add to Phase 9 if needed)
  - Password: Min length 8 only (KISS for MVP)
  - Rate limiting: Yes, add to login endpoint (5 attempts/min)
  - Expiry testing: Logic only, no actual time delays
  - PR count: 2 PRs

  But I want your input before planning the work!

(i will go with recommendations)

STAGE 4

ok now we need to starte with stage 4 (4.1 - 4.7), check it in
  @PROJECT_FLOW_DOCS/HANDOFF.md  - first check what we built, see
  @PROJECT_FLOW_DOCS/INIT_PROMPT.md. Then we need split 4.1-4.7 to some
  logicall pull request so we do not send all code in one pull request.
  Suggest  something first. Then plan the work, if you see something too
  open, not clear or something which can lead to overcomplication od the
  system - ask me 6 short but stron questions so yuo weill have clarity
  what we need in stage 4 which is consistent with other elemements in
  system. After that we need a clear plan.

I propose 3 PRs to keep reviews manageable:

  PR #5: Foundational Services (4.1 + 4.2)

  - SUPADATA client + Chunking service
  - Why together: Both are independent utilities, can be mocked/tested
  in isolation
  - Complexity: Medium
  - Tests: Unit tests with mocked API responses

  PR #6: Vector Infrastructure (4.3 + 4.4)

  - Embedding service + Qdrant service
  - Why together: Tightly coupled (embeddings feed into Qdrant)
  - Complexity: Medium-High (requires Qdrant running)
  - Tests: Unit tests + basic integration tests

  PR #7: Pipeline Integration (4.5 + 4.6 + 4.7)

  - Full orchestration + API endpoint + seed script
  - Why together: Tests the complete flow end-to-end
  - Complexity: High (integration of all services)
  - Tests: Integration tests + end-to-end flow

Before planning, I need clarity on these points to avoid
  overcomplication:

  1. SUPADATA API Access

  Do you have an actual SUPADATA API key, or should I mock the entire
  SUPADATA client for MVP? (If mocked, I'll return hardcoded sample
  transcripts)

  2. YouTube URL Parsing

  Should I handle both URL formats (youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID and
  youtu.be/VIDEO_ID), or require users to provide clean video IDs only?

  3. Duplicate Transcript Handling

  When user tries to ingest the same video twice (same youtube_video_id
   + user_id):
  - (a) Reject with 409 error "Already ingested"
  - (b) Update/re-ingest (delete old, ingest new)
  - (c) Return existing transcript metadata (idempotent)

  4. Very Short Transcripts

  If a transcript is < 150 tokens total (below minimum chunk size):
  - (a) Keep as single chunk (ignore minimum rule)
  - (b) Reject as "too short to process"

  5. Pipeline Failure Rollback

  If pipeline fails midway (e.g., Qdrant upload fails but Postgres
  succeeded):
  - (a) Keep partial data (transcript + chunks in Postgres, orphaned)
  - (b) Full rollback (delete transcript + chunks, like transaction)
  - (c) Mark transcript as "failed" status (add status field?)

  6. Qdrant Collection Setup

  For the youtube_chunks collection:
  - (a) Auto-create on first ingest if missing (smart)
  - (b) Create via migration/setup script (controlled)
  - (c) Manual setup only (documented in README)

Answers and some questions.

1. i have a supadata api key, so we need use it and put in .env. SO if we 
will test the system we will use real data from real movies. For tests (unit, integra etc) we can just mock it
and do not use real api keys to collect data
2. both formats are correct
3. a) already ingested
4. a) keep a single
5. i think we need discuss this subject. For this i think we need keep partial.
6. b) i think it will be good when we go production - or not?

Also we need talk about 5 and situations wneh some element of graph failed, api not responding etc.
Is langchain/langgraph have any mechanism for retries? check the web search if needed.
This will be in stare 5 but we need be sure which way to go.

Answer first then we can continue planning.

(there is answer from ai)

ok we need write (LANGCHAIN_RETRY.md inside @PROJECT_FLOW_DOCS/ ) our
  findings about retry and put in some file so we can back to it in next
  stage and also we need write a stage 4 plan in STAGE_4_PLAN.md inside
  @PROJECT_FLOW_DOCS/stages/ - this retry document need to be attached
  (mentioned) in @PROJECT_FLOW_DOCS/HANDOFF.md so you will know when to
  use it.

Q1. option A - simple
Q2. option A - check existing
Q3. option A
