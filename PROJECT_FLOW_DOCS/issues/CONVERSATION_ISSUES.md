 what do you think about that hardcoded query cases,maybe can we use 
that llm can decide the intention and llm make some decisions itself, 
based on exaplle queries. Or maybe it works like that now? Just tell 
me what is coded now, how it works? is current solution universal or 
its easy to break the system and get some generic unrelated answers?
 I see examples in polish and english but what about if user start talk in Spanish?
Maybe can we plan a some tricky or hacky questions and we cna check 
how LLM will answer and then we can improve our system, not only for 
channels but for regular chats also. DO te research first.
